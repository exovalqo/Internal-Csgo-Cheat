# Internal-Csgo-Cheat
Original Internal CSGO Cheat by Exovalqo
 
Hello Everyone!
This is my first "real" game cheat. This was for educational purposes only.

It is fully internal  

This project includes:  
-Aimbot  
-Esp (Directx9)

What this taught me:  
-Various Game Development Structures (Vectors, Euler Angles, Multiple Class Inheritance, Game Loops, etc)  
-Graphic Concepts (Graphics Pipeline, 3D(World) to 2D(Screen), Transformation Matrixes, DirectX API, etc)  
-Function Hooking (Trampoline, Detour, Dummy DirectX Device, Virtual Tables)  
-Signature Scanning (Sequence of Bytes and Wildcards)  

This project served mainly for me to get a deeper insight of the memory structure of video games. It taught me virtual functions are aligned within memory through a vtable pointer, how to access variables with cheat engine or another debugger, how to patch bytes to create jmp hooks, and byte scanning to find variables or functions.
