# Internal-Csgo-Cheat
Original Internal CSGO Cheat by Exovalqo
 
Hello Everyone!
This is my first "real" game cheat. This was for educational purposes only.

It is fully internal

This project includes:
-Aimbot
-Esp (Directx9)

What this taught me:
-Various Game Development Structures (Vectors, Euler Angles, Multiple Class Inheritance, Game Loops, etc)
-Graphic Concepts (Graphics Pipeline, 3D(World) to 2D(Screen), Transformation Matrixes, DirectX API, etc)
-Function Hooking (Trampoline, Detour, Dummy DirectX Device, Virtual Tables)
-Signature Scanning (Sequence of Bytes and Wildcards)

This project served mainly for me to get a deeper insight of how classes and functions are held within memory. This includes machine code understanding for utilization of hooking and virtual function accessing.
